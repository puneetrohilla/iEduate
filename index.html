          Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge,
          behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. The ability to
          learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines; there is
          also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants. Some
          learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by
          a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated
          experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime,
          and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost"
          from that which cannot be retrieved.

          Play has been approached by several theorists as a form of learning.
          Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to
          interact through play. Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for
          children's development, since they make meaning of their environment
          through playing educational games. For Vygotsky, however, play is the
          first form of learning language and communication and the stage where
          a child begins to understand rules and symbols.

          Active learning occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning
          experience. Since understanding information is the key aspect of
          learning, it is important for learners t o recognize what they
          understand and what they do not. By doing so, they can monitor their
          own mastery of subjects. Active learning encourages learners to have
          an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings. This and
          other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time.
          Studies within metacognition have proven the value in active learning,
          claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level.
